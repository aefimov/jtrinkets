#summary documentation of libraries bundle for JniClassLoader.

= Introduction =

The JniClassLoader support loading of JNI libraries from packed JAR archive. The JAR archive may contains libraries for different operating systems. It also must have META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file inside with set of entries for each binary file:
{{{
Manifest-Version: 1.0

Name: windows/JNIHelloWorld.dll
Platform: Windows

Name: windows/depended.dll
Platform: Windows

Name: linux/JNIHelloWorld.so
Platform: Linux
}}}
Everyone entry has special attribute — *Platform* which determinate target operating system for this binary library file. It will be unpacked only on correct platform. The platform is matching to JVM system property — os.name, by 'contains' condition. Here is piece of code from module:
{{{
  String platform = attributes.getValue("Platform");
  if (platform != null && System.getProperty("os.name", "").toLowerCase().contains(platform.toLowerCase())) {
     // Unpack here
  }

}}}

The binary files will unpacked to temporary folder specified in JNIBundleLoader constructor and then loaded from this folder correctly to JVM.

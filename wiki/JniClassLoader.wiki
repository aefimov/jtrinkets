This module help to use JNI libraries simple. Basicaly using of JNI libraries has requirement — you must have all libraries accessable from paths defined in java.library.path system property of JVM. This java.library.path property cannot be changed from Java program. The only one possible way to load your native library from any location — is to use special classloader, who know where is your library is located.

The jniClassLoader module is trinket component with already implemented such classloader. It have one useful feature and some cosmetic features.
